**SINDIKASI**


**Bagirata**

**[Collective Actions in Tech]**(https://collectiveactions.tech/) is a project that attempts to document all collective actions from workers in the tech industry. The goal of this archive is to provide data and insights on organizing in the tech industry, to find the connections between different efforts, and to build worker power in tech. The archive lives on GitHub as a repository. Please visit our repository for more information. Collective Action in Tech is maintained by JS Tan, a tech worker, and Nataliya Nedzhvetskaya, a sociologist who researches tech and labor. In 2019, the pair wrote [an article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/22/tech-worker-activism-2019-what-we-learned) for _The Guardian_ characterizing the tech labor movement over the past decade.
